## Lesson Learned
This project was an invaluable journey into the integration of Streamlit with SQLite, highlighting the nuances of building a functional web application. The critical learning curve was managing database connectionsâ€”specifically, the importance of diligently closing connections post-transaction to prevent database locks and ensure seamless user experiences. This experience underscored the significance of robust backend management in the development of interactive web applications.

## Questions/Further Improvement
UI/UX Design: A priority for future development is to overhaul the UI/UX design. Enhancing visual elements and user interaction will make the application more appealing and intuitive.
Feature Expansion: Considering the addition of categorization for tasks (e.g., personal, work, urgent) and implementing due dates to bolster the application's utility.
Performance Optimization: Investigating methods to optimize query performance for a more responsive user experience, especially as the task list grows.
